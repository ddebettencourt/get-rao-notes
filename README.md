# Get-Rao-Notes

This Python script grabs Professor Rao's lecture notes from the course website.

## Usage

NOTE: urllib is required.

First, create a folder that you want to save the notes into, and update line 12 of get-rao-notes.py to reflect that change.

Then, it's as simple as running:
`python3 get-rao-notes.py`
